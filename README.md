# bulk_transcriptomics_example
This repository showcases my scripts to analyze bulk transcriptomics data from raw mapped reads. The raw reads were filtered, normalized, and differential expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with EdgeR. Gene ontology enrichment was also conducted. Primary results/figures generated from this analysis were listed in this repository as well.
